1. Keep user logged in function does not start other sessions.
2. Chat problem, messages beyond limit do not display.
3. Cache pages on device memory.
4. On validate, got to remove the __construct function because it seems useless as the properties may be initialised right at their position.
5. When fetching followers you should exec that (But I might be right the way I did it at first).
6. On chat where page when refreshed the _GET details fade, you have to set that when the page is refreshed it goes back to chat.
7. Some ids are unknown on a new account for my dad Themba Dube. It's actually the recently added accounts.
8. I have to fix the issue of image posts that a user is able to post an image with or without a caption.
9. On index.php, take the chat system to its own private file. because index should be with news feed.
10. When deleting posts make sure that tables in relationships also delete corresponding rows.
